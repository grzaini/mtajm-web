#### Audio Collection Website
Website for collections of songs of Mullah Taj Mohammad. This website contains more than 200 songs of the Mullah Taj Mohammad -one of the Uzbek peoples in north Afghanistan. 

This website is created simplay by HTML, CSS and Javascript in two languages (English and Uzbekish). I have used the “i18n” Internationalization and Localization approach to translate into languages and the data is stored in two separated JSON files, one is for English language and another is for Uzbekish language. But this separation caused the page to be load entirely when the user clicks on any languages. I will work on it in the future and will solve this issue. Since the site contains lots of audio files which makes it overwhelming and is not suitable for weak internet connection, I have used “Lazy Load” java script technique to reduce the entire load.
